When we play games, we get excited over the game's looks, character capabilities, control/ux, and its reputation
If we get excited by such a game, I'll consider this "taking an interest" in the game.
3 things (non-exhaustive) that we might want to do with our interest:
Own the digital assets for free use in other applications or our own fantasies
Indulge/spend time on it (perhaps mastering skills in the game) 
Share that interest with existing friends and family to deepen our bonds with them.
Point 1 is being solved with NFT and I trust it's a matter of time before it gets figured out.
Point 2 is based on our own free will though availability to practice team based skills is lacking because you must amass trustworthy teammates in order to practice team based skills in a safe environment. AI assistants might be the answer.
Point 3, to the best of my knowledge is not being worked on yet. Currently, you can 
get your friend interested enough in your game and spend time together that way,
pretend you’re interested in their game and ditch your game in order to bond with your friend,
both compromise by playing a completely different game that you both can pretend to love,
be lunch and dinner friends only,
naturally drift apart… :o
To spell it out, the issue seems to be relevancy. My game is not relevant to yours because they are parallel worlds.
We seek to Create mix/merge games that join parallel worlds together! Think “Re:Creator”, “Marvel Universe” (but not really), or that excitement you get when you see tributes in movies to your favorite drama.

Imagine that you can mix/merge the games that each of you already love and play that game together instead without having to pretend that you’re interested.
Imagine being able to keep honing skills in that mix/merge game so that you don’t fall behind in your own game
Imagine still being able to buy skins or collectables in your game community and see that update in your mix/merge game
